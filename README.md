##  Project Structure

Keylogger_Cybersecurity_Project
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ **keylogger.py**   >   *Main keylogging script*
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ **detect\_keylogger.py**  >   *Detection script to flag if keystrokes are logged*
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keystrokes.txt          # Text file storing captured keystrokes (for demo/framework) #
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               * Project documentation you are viewing now*


##  Features

-  Captures keystrokes in real time using Python‚Äôs `pynput` library  
-  Saves key logs in `keystrokes.txt`  
-  Runs silently in the background  
-  Includes a detection mechanism (`detect_keylogger.py`) to alert for existing logs  
-  Lightweight and beginner-friendly for learning cybersecurity fundamentals


##  How to Use

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system:
   *python --version*

2. Install the required Python package:
   *pip install pynput*

3. Run the keylogger:
  * python keylogger.py*

4. View the logs:
   *keystrokes.txt*

5. To check if logging has been performed, run:
   *python detect_keylogger.py*

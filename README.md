# üõ°Ô∏è Keylogger Cybersecurity Project 

A simple yet effective **Python-based keylogger** developed during a cybersecurity internship to demonstrate keystroke capturing, log storage, and basic detection mechanisms.

##  Project Structure

**Keylogger_Cybersecurity_Project**

|

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ **keylogger.py**   >   *Main keylogging script*

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ **detect_keylogger.py**  >   *Detection script to flag if keystrokes are logged*

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ **keystrokes.txt**     >  *Text file storing captured keystrokes (for demo/framework)*

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ **README.md**     >   *Project documentation you are viewing now*


##  Features

-  Captures keystrokes in real time using Python‚Äôs `pynput` library  
-  Saves key logs in `keystrokes.txt`  
-  Runs silently in the background  
-  Includes a detection mechanism (`detect_keylogger.py`) to alert for existing logs  
-  Lightweight and beginner-friendly for learning cybersecurity fundamentals


##  How to Use

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system:
   *python --version*

2. Install the required Python package:
   *pip install pynput*

3. Run the keylogger:
   *python keylogger.py*

5. View the logs:
   *keystrokes.txt*

6. To check if logging has been performed, run:
   *python detect_keylogger.py*
